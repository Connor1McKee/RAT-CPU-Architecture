This is the repository for the RAT CPU architecture. This code base can be launched with the Vivado Design Suite
through the xpr file and is set to run the Bubble Blast game upon generating the bitstream. Necessary peripherals
required to play the game include a standard keyboard, a VGA monitor, and a VGA cable.


For our final project, my partner and I attempted to recreate the retro game "Bubble Blast". This involved creating graphics and cursor animations output to a VGA screen with projectile firing and recursive neighbor bound checking.
